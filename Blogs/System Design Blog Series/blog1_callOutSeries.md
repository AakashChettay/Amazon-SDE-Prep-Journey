Ready to level up your career from just a coder to a system architect? 🚀<br><br>

That’s my mission, and I'm inviting you to join me. I’m kicking off a weekly blog series to demystify System Design, one of the most critical skills for landing a top-tier SDE role. 🎯<br><br>

For this series, a solid grasp of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) using Java will be a helpful starting point. ☕<br><br>

Every Sunday 🗓️, I’ll be sharing a deep dive, starting with the foundational SOLID principles this weekend. Then, we'll crack the code on all 23 Design Patterns, complete with my own real-world, self-created examples. 🛠️<br><br>

I believe consistency is key to mastery, and this blog is my public commitment. Let’s build our knowledge base, one pattern at a time. 🏗️<br><br>

If you’re ready to grow, learn, and master the art of building scalable systems, hit that follow button and join the journey! 👉<br><br>
