# My Journey to Become an Amazon SDE 

Hello! My name is Aakash Chettay, and this repository documents my preparation journey to land a Software Development Engineer (SDE) role at Amazon as an experienced professional. I am currently working at Accenture and am committed to this goal.

## My Preparation Strategy

My plan is to be "pro" at two key areas: Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA) and System Design. I will maintain a consistent daily study schedule and document my progress here.

## Repository Structure

-   `DSA/`: This directory will contain my daily progress on Data Structures and Algorithms problems. Each folder will be named by day and topic, e.g., `day_1_arrays_two_sum`.
-   `SystemDesign/`: This directory will document my learning in System Design, from fundamental concepts to designing real-world systems. Each folder will be named similarly, e.g., `day_2_design_a_url_shortener`.

## Consistency Pledge

I pledge to make a commit to this repository every single day. The streak will be a public testament to my dedication. I understand that consistency is more important than speed.

Let's do this!
