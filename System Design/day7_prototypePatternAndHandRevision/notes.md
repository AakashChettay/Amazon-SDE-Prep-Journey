**Prototype Pattern**<br><br>
"Prototype pattern creates duplicate objects while keeping performance in mind. It provides a mechanism to copy the original object to a new one without making the code dependent on their classes."<br><br>
**Real-life Analogy (Photocopy Machine)**<br><br>
Think of preparing ten offer letters. Instead of typing the same letter ten times, you write it once, photocopy it, and change just the name on each copy. This is how the Prototype Pattern works: start with a base object and produce modified copies with minimal changes.<br><br>
