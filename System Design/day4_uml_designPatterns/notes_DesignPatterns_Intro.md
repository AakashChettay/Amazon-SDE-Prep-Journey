**Design Patterns**<br><br>
* Design patterns are standard, time-tested solutions to common software design problems. They are not code templates but abstract descriptions or blueprints that help developers solve issues in code architecture and system design.<br><br>
**The Three Categories of Design Patterns**<br><br>
1. __Creational Patterns:__ These focus on object creation mechanisms, trying to create objects in a manner suitable to the situation. They abstract the instantiation process, making the system independent of how its objects are created.<br>
    __Types:__<br>
    1. Singleton
    2. Factory Method
    3. Abstract Factory
    4. Builder
    5. Prototype<br><br>
2. __Structural Patterns:__ These deal with object composition — how classes and objects can be combined to form larger structures while keeping the system flexible and efficient. It helps systems to work together that otherwise could not because of incompatible interfaces.<br>
    __Types:__<br>
    1. Adapter
    2. Bridge
    3. Composite
    4. Decorator
    5. Facade
    6. Flyweight
    7. Proxy<br><br>
3. __Behavioral Patterns:__ These are concerned with object interaction and responsibility — how they communicate and assign responsibilities while ensuring loose coupling.<br>
    __Types:__
    1. Observer
    2. Strategy
    3. Command
    4. Chain of Responsibility
    5. Mediator
    6. State
    7. Template Method
    8. Visitor
    9. Iterator
    10. Memento
    11. Interpreter<br><br>
