**Composite Pattern**<br><br>
The Composite Pattern is a structural design pattern that allows you to compose objects into tree structures to represent part-whole hierarchies. It lets clients treat individual objects and compositions of objects uniformly.<br><br>
**Problem It Solves**<br><br>
The Composite Pattern solves the problem of treating individual objects and groups of objects in the same way. The main problem arises when:
* You want to work with a hierarchy of objects.
* You want the client code to be agnostic to whether it's dealing with a single object or a collection of them.
